6. In the terminal `cd` into the path you have seen from CloudWatch log, you will see the files you need are inside the directory. Just archive all the files into a tar file e.g. `map.tar`

7. In your local machine, run the command `nc -l -p <port> > map.tar`, this command will listen to the port, and write any incoming data into the file `map.tar` in your machine

   If your machine is behind a router, you may want to set the port forwarding to route any incoming data for that port to your machine

8. Back to the RoboMaker, run the command `nc <your_local_machine_ip> <port> < /path/to/map.tar`

   This command send the tar file, which you have just made, as byte stream to your local machine. Your local machine will receive it by the `nc` command you are running and save it as a file in your local machine

9. After downloading the file into your local machine, simply unzip it and get the files you want
